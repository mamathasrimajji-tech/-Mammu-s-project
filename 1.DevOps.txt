1.DevOps:
Introduction what is DevOps?
DevOps=Development + Operations
it's a culture + set of practices + tools that help:
Developers (who write code)
Operations (who deploy/ manage systems)
work together instead of working in silos.
Real-Time Example:
Imagine you're building a mobile app link Swiggy.
The developer writes code to add "Track My Order" feature.
Without DevOps: Developer gives code to Ops team-> they manually deploy-> bugs happen -> delays
With DevOps: code is automatically tested & deployed-> customer get updated faster & safely
DevOps help you: 
release features faster (like adding new payment methods in Zomato)
Fix bugs quickly (like fixing login issue in IRCTC)
Automate repetitive tasks (like serve restarts, data-base backups)
2.8 phase of DevOps LIFE-CYCLE:
plan - define what to build
DevOps - write the code
Build - Compile code into deployable format
Test - Checks for bugs automatically
Release - Approach the build for deployment
Deploy - push app to server or app store 
Operate - Keep app running , fix any issue
Monitor - Analyze performance & feedback 
   Cycle continues: feedback to users-> back to plan
3.GitHub Basics:
what is Git & GitHub
Git = version control system (local)
GitHub = Online platform to store Git projects
Real time Analogy: Work together on the same project 
Real time Example: 
you're working with a team on an online shopping website
